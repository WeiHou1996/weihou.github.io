I am a PhD candidate at California Institute of Technology working with Prof. Tim Colonius. I am interested in computational methods and their applications in fluid mechanics.

High-fidelity and high-performance numerical algorithms
------
We derive and implement large-scale numerical simulation algorithms for incompressible external flows. Specifically, I work on applying lattice Green's function, immersed boundary method, and adaptive mesh refinement to simulate high Reynolds number flows with accurate far-field outer flows.

Flow analysis using eigenspectrum and pseudospectrum
------
We utilize large-scale computation to study the stability and sensitivity of flows via stability analysis and resolvent analysis.

Machine learning algorithms for gust detection
------
I worked on machine learning algorithms for gust detection from surface measurements. We created a new machine learning framework to predict the onset of gusts in the flow effectively. We also derived accompanying regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and regularization algorithms to find optimal sensor placement locations for gust detection.
